This module let you analyze a mp3 audio file using vamp plugin: QM segmenter. Process will create triggers based  on the segment.
Different mode of segmentation can be used.You will have also the possibility to run all sequences in sequential order from two clicks.
This could be helpfull on light show creation using LED strip (but not only).

Module has been devlopped with WLED and LedFX on mind, so if you're using them, some specifics features has been implemented:
  for WLED : you can put WLED lights strip(s) on live mode
  for LedFX : this will create for each triggers, actions (consequences) 
                   and set corresponding LedFX effect to the virtual device.
                   (we are near automatic light show generation)

Modules WLED and/or LedFX are required for use them.

Hope you will enjoy using it...Thanks to chataigne to have made that a reality !
