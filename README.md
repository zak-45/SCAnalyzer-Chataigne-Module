# SCAnalyzer-Chataigne-Module
Song analyzer, timecoded sequence creation. Actions/ Triggers execution based on segmenter/rhythm difference. 

This is on early stage. Not to be used as it is whithout any Chataigne's script knowledge.

Main goal is to help to create sequence with actions/triggers execution based on these two Vamp plugins: QM Segmenter and BBC Rhythm Difference.
The Sonic Annotator extraction tool is necessary. 
This module is deeply integrated with WLED and Ledfx, so if you use the corresponding modules, it will automaticaly create actions for them.
